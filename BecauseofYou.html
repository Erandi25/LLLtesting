                <h1>Because of You, Life Doesn’t Stop</h1>
                <p>Every four seconds, someone in Sri Lanka needs blood or platelets.</p>
            </div>
        </header>
        <main class="main-content">

            <p>This could be a child battling dengue, a patient undergoing life-saving surgery, or someone in a car accident. Every donation helps someone in urgent need, and it is through your generosity that these individuals receive the care they need to survive and heal.
                <br><br>
                Blood and platelets are irreplaceable, and without regular donors, hospitals cannot maintain adequate supplies. The need is constant, as blood can only be stored for a limited time before it expires. This means there is always a demand for fresh blood donations, and the cycle of giving never stops.
                <br><br>
                If you’re hesitant about donating, rest assured-most donors describe it as a quick, mild pinch! The process is safe, efficient, and deeply rewarding, knowing you might save up to three lives with one donation. Imagine the relief you can provide to a family waiting for a loved one’s surgery or the hope you give to a child fighting a life-threatening illness.
                <br><br>
                Donating blood is not only an act of kindness but also a simple way to make a lasting difference in your community. In Sri Lanka, the demand for blood donations is high, and it is through your participation that the system can continue to function effectively. No one knows when they or their loved ones might need blood, and by becoming a regular donor, you ensure that there is always a supply available.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, blood donation has health benefits for the donor as well. It helps improve circulation, maintains healthy iron levels, and reduces the risk of certain diseases. It's a win-win situation for both the person in need and the donor.
                <br></p><br>
                <h2>Becoming a Donor:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>The process to donate blood is straightforward and quick. After a brief consultation to assess your health, you will be comfortably seated while your blood is drawn. The entire procedure takes about 10 minutes, and once you are finished, you will be given snacks and drinks to help replenish your energy.
                <br><br>
                You can donate as often as every 8 weeks for whole blood donations, or more frequently for plasma and platelet donations. Each donation may help save up to three people, making you a hero to those who depend on it most.
                <br><br>
                Your act of giving might seem small, but its impact is immeasurable. It’s a simple, selfless act that has the power to change lives, bring hope, and save families. Because of you, life doesn’t stop.
